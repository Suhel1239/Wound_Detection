# Wound_Detection
This model is capable of detecting and segmenting the wound areas and categorise them into acute and chronic wounds.<br/>
-> I used YOLOv7 segmentation model for this project.<br/>
-> I also built a UI for both realtime wound detection and getting segmented wound image from a wound image.<br/>
